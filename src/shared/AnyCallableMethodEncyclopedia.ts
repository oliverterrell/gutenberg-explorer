/**
 * This is the `ChatCompletionTool` type from OpenAI
 * -
 * or at least how that type is used in this app. Some of the unused union types cause theirs to
 * not play nice when casting the "function" property to Gemini's FunctionDeclarationTool type.
 *
 * While it's more clear to use the OpenAI type directly, this type appeases the TypeScript compiler
 * making dev process less of a pain.
 *
 * _Anyone familiar with the OpenAi Node client should have no trouble writing an A.C.M.E. definition._
